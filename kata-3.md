# "Legal Eagle" - Law Firm Voice AI Case Intake Quest üéØ

## System Overview
Voice-first AI system for Legal Services handling Case Management Integration with Sandboxed Processing capability. Potential clients and existing clients call to report legal issues, schedule consultations, provide case updates, and submit initial case information. AI handles conversations during after-hours and peak consultation periods or when all attorneys and paralegals are busy, captures sensitive legal information, case details, and client communications, processes data in secure sandboxed environment for privacy compliance, and creates prioritized case files for legal staff to review.

Core Problem: Law firm receives 150+ client calls daily, with 40% being initial consultations that require immediate documentation. After 6 PM and weekends, urgent legal matters go to voicemail causing case delays. Due to attorney-client privilege and confidentiality requirements, sensitive information cannot be processed through standard cloud LLMs. Voice AI provides always-available legal intake with sandboxed processing and secure case management integration.

## Quest Stories & Victory Conditions üèÜ

### Story 1: Basic Call Handling [1 XP]
As a potential client  
I want to call and have the AI answer immediately  
So that I can report urgent legal matters anytime

Description:
As a practicing attorney with 15 years of experience in client relations, I understand that legal emergencies don't follow business hours. Whether it's a potential client facing arrest, a civil matter with approaching deadlines, or an existing client needing urgent consultation, immediate professional response is crucial for both case outcomes and client confidence. The first impression when someone calls our firm often determines whether they'll retain our services, making a professional, always-available intake system essential for practice growth and client satisfaction.

Victory Conditions:
- Given I dial the legal intake number When call connects Then AI greets me with "Hello, you've reached Sterling & Associates legal intake. I'm here to help document your legal matter. How can I assist you today?"

---

### Story 2: Speech-to-Text Capture [2 XP]
As a voice AI system  
I want to convert client speech to text accurately  
So that I can process legal terminology and case details properly

Description:
Having managed hundreds of client intakes, I've learned that accurate documentation from the very first conversation is absolutely critical in legal practice. Clients often use specific legal terminology they've researched, mention case numbers, court dates, and opposing parties that must be captured precisely. Misunderstanding even a single detail during initial intake can lead to missed deadlines, jurisdictional errors, or inadequate case preparation. The system must handle everything from emotional, fast-talking clients to those carefully spelling out complex legal entity names.

Victory Conditions:
- Given client says "I need help with a breach of contract case against Morrison LLC" When speech is processed Then system captures legal request and entity name accurately
- Given legal terminology spoken When processing Then correctly identifies "breach", "contract", "LLC", "plaintiff", "defendant" etc.

---

### Story 3: Text-to-Speech Responses [3 XP]
As a potential client  
I want to hear professional, empathetic responses from the AI  
So that I trust the system with sensitive legal information

Description:
In my experience as a senior paralegal specializing in client communications, the tone and professionalism of initial client contact directly impacts their willingness to share sensitive information. Legal clients are often stressed, confused, or emotionally vulnerable when they call. They need to hear measured, professional responses that convey competence without being cold or intimidating. The AI must sound like a trained legal professional who understands the gravity of legal matters while maintaining the warm, accessible tone that helps clients feel comfortable sharing potentially embarrassing or incriminating details.

Victory Conditions:
- Given AI needs to request sensitive information When speaking to client Then response sounds professional, empathetic, and builds trust
- Given AI discusses legal concepts When speaking Then clearly explains terms and maintains appropriate professional tone

---

### Story 4: Client Identity Collection [4 XP]
As a voice AI  
I want to collect comprehensive client identification  
So that I can create proper case files and check for conflicts of interest

Description:
After handling over a thousand client intakes across multiple practice areas, I know that thorough identification at first contact prevents countless problems downstream. We need full legal names (not nicknames), current addresses for service of process, reliable contact numbers, and birth dates for background checks. This information is crucial for conflicts checking - we must identify if we've represented opposing parties, family members, or business associates. Incomplete identification often results in having to re-contact clients for basic information, delaying case initiation and creating unprofessional impressions.

Victory Conditions:
- Given AI requests identification When client provides "Sarah Michelle Johnson, 1425 Oak Street, born June 3rd 1985" Then complete identity details captured for legal file creation
- Given identity collected When confirming Then AI confirms "I have Sarah Michelle Johnson, 1425 Oak Street, date of birth June 3rd, 1985, is this correct?"

---

### Story 5: Case Reference Number Generation [2 XP]
As a voice AI system  
I want to generate unique case reference numbers  
So that each legal matter can be tracked and organized properly

Description:
As a law firm administrator with deep experience in case management systems, I understand that proper case numbering from initial contact is fundamental to legal practice organization. Every potential case needs immediate assignment of a unique identifier that will follow it through intake, conflicts checking, retainer agreements, and eventual case files. The numbering system must integrate with our existing case management protocols, be easily referenced by both staff and clients, and provide clear tracking for billing and document organization purposes.

Victory Conditions:
- Given new client contact initiated When case intake begins Then AI generates unique case reference "LC2024-0001" format and provides to client
- Given case number generated When confirming with client Then AI states "Your matter has been assigned reference number LC2024-0001 for our records"

---

### Story 6: Sandboxed Processing Detection [4 XP]
As a system  
I want to ensure all sensitive legal information remains in secure sandboxed environment  
So that attorney-client privilege and confidentiality are maintained

Description:
As a legal ethics specialist who has dealt with numerous confidentiality breaches, I cannot overstate how critical it is that client information never leaves our controlled environment. Attorney-client privilege is the cornerstone of legal practice, and any external processing of client communications could waive this protection. The sandboxed processing ensures that sensitive case details, client admissions, and strategic legal information are processed entirely within our secure infrastructure, maintaining both ethical obligations and regulatory compliance while providing the AI functionality our practice needs.

Victory Conditions:
- Given client shares sensitive legal information When processing conversation Then AI confirms "All information is being processed securely within our protected legal system"
- Given sandboxed environment activated When system status checked Then displays "Secure Legal Processing Mode Active - No External Data Transmission"

---

### Story 7: Legal Matter Classification [6 XP]
As a voice AI system  
I want to categorize legal matters by practice area and urgency  
So that cases are routed to appropriate attorneys immediately

Description:
Throughout my career as a managing partner, I've seen how proper initial case classification dramatically impacts both client outcomes and firm efficiency. Personal injury cases need immediate attention for evidence preservation and medical documentation. Family law matters often involve urgent custody or safety issues. Corporate clients may have time-sensitive regulatory deadlines. The AI must understand the nuances of different practice areas - recognizing when someone describes a slip-and-fall versus a medical malpractice case, or distinguishing between routine contract review and emergency injunctive relief needs.

Victory Conditions:
- Given client describes "I was injured in a car accident yesterday and the insurance company is calling" When AI processes case type Then categorizes as "Personal Injury - Motor Vehicle" with "High" urgency due to evidence preservation needs
- Given multiple practice area indicators When analyzing case Then AI asks clarifying questions to properly categorize between related areas like "Employment Law" versus "Civil Rights"

---

### Story 8: Detailed Legal Issue Documentation [8 XP]
As a voice AI system  
I want to capture comprehensive case narratives and legal issue details  
So that attorneys have complete information for case evaluation

Description:
As a litigation partner who has reviewed thousands of initial client interviews, I know that the quality of initial case documentation directly determines our ability to provide accurate legal advice and case valuations. Clients often don't know which details are legally significant - they might emphasize emotional aspects while glossing over crucial facts like notice periods, statute of limitations deadlines, or witness information. The AI must guide clients through comprehensive fact-gathering while capturing exact quotes, dates, and sequences of events that will be critical for legal analysis and case strategy development.

Victory Conditions:
- Given client describes complex legal situation When AI facilitates documentation Then captures chronological sequence of events, key dates, involved parties, and potential legal claims
- Given incomplete initial description When analyzing case details Then AI asks targeted follow-up questions like "Do you have any written documentation of this agreement?" or "What was the specific date this occurred?"

---

### Story 9: Basic Staff Authentication [3 XP]
As a law firm staff member  
I want to log into a secure case management system  
So that I can access client intake information and case assignments

Description:
Having served as a firm's IT administrator, I understand that legal practice software requires enhanced security protocols beyond typical business applications. Attorney-client privilege demands that only authorized personnel can access case information, and we must maintain detailed audit trails of who viewed what information and when. The authentication system must integrate with our existing access controls while providing the security necessary for confidential legal matters and client trust.

Victory Conditions:
- Given valid staff credentials When logging into legal system Then access granted to appropriate case dashboard with role-based permissions
- Given invalid credentials When attempting login Then access denied with security logging and potential lockout protocols activated

---

### Story 10: Secure Case File Creation [6 XP]
As a voice AI system  
I want to create structured case files from client conversations  
So that legal staff can immediately begin case evaluation and conflicts checking

Description:
As a paralegal with extensive experience in case file management, I've learned that proper file structure from day one prevents countless hours of reorganization and potential malpractice issues. Each case file must include complete client identification, detailed fact patterns, relevant dates and deadlines, potential defendants or opposing parties, and preliminary legal issue identification. This structured approach allows attorneys to quickly assess case viability, identify conflicts of interest, and determine appropriate next steps for client service and case development.

Victory Conditions:
- Given completed client conversation When intake session ends Then structured case file created with client details, case narrative, legal issues identified, and urgency level assigned
- Given case file created When storing Then includes conversation timestamp, duration, audio recording reference, and preliminary conflicts check data

---

### Story 11: Urgent Legal Matter Detection and Escalation [9 XP]
As a legal triage system  
I want to identify time-sensitive legal issues requiring immediate attorney attention  
So that critical deadlines and emergency matters are handled promptly

Description:
In my role as a senior attorney handling emergency legal matters, I've seen how missing critical deadlines can destroy otherwise strong cases and expose the firm to malpractice liability. The AI must recognize various types of legal emergencies: impending statute of limitations deadlines, active court proceedings with approaching dates, criminal arrests requiring immediate representation, restraining order violations, and business crises requiring emergency injunctive relief. The system should understand that what seems routine to a client might be legally urgent, such as a "simple" employment termination that occurred just before a pregnancy announcement.

Victory Conditions:
- Given client mentions "I have a court date next week but my lawyer isn't returning calls" When AI analyzes urgency Then immediately flags as "Emergency - Active Legal Proceeding" and creates immediate callback request
- Given potential statute of limitations issue detected When processing timeline Then AI asks specific questions about incident dates and creates high-priority alert for attorney review

### Story 12: Attorney Dashboard with Case Priority Management [12 XP]
As a practicing attorney  
I want to view all new client matters prioritized by urgency and practice area  
So that I can efficiently manage my caseload and meet all deadlines

Description:
As a partner managing both my own caseload and supervising junior attorneys, I need immediate visibility into incoming cases that allows for strategic case acceptance and workload distribution. The dashboard must present cases in order of legal urgency - not just client emotion - while showing potential case value, required expertise, and time sensitivities. I need to quickly assess which matters require immediate action, which can be scheduled for routine consultation, and which should be referred to other attorneys based on specialization or capacity. This efficient case triage directly impacts both client satisfaction and firm profitability.

Victory Conditions:
- Given attorney accesses dashboard When viewing new cases Then sees prioritized list with emergency matters, approaching deadlines, and high-value cases prominently displayed
- Given case list displayed When reviewing Then shows client name, case type, urgency level, potential case value indicators, and time received
- Given filtering and sorting options When managing caseload Then can view by practice area, urgency level, referring source, and potential case value

---

### Story 13: Sandboxed Data Processing and Validation [4 XP]
As a system  
I want to validate all client information within secure environment  
So that data integrity is maintained while protecting confidentiality

Description:
As a legal technology consultant specializing in confidentiality compliance, I understand that legal practices face unique challenges in data processing. Unlike other industries, we cannot risk external data validation that might compromise attorney-client privilege. The sandboxed environment must perform comprehensive data validation - checking for complete contact information, logical case timelines, and potential conflicts - all while ensuring that sensitive client communications never leave our controlled infrastructure. This approach maintains both the efficiency benefits of AI processing and the confidentiality requirements of legal practice.

Victory Conditions:
- Given client information collected When processing within sandbox Then validates data completeness and consistency without external transmission
- Given data validation complete When presenting to staff Then flags incomplete information, potential conflicts, and recommended follow-up actions

---

### Story 14: Comprehensive Case Detail Management [8 XP]
As a attorney  
I want to review complete client interaction details and manage case status  
So that I can make informed decisions about case acceptance and initial strategy

Description:
After 20 years of legal practice, I know that thorough review of initial client contact information often reveals case strengths and weaknesses that determine both our strategy and our decision to accept representation. I need access to the complete conversation transcript, emotional context from voice analysis, and preliminary legal issue assessment. This comprehensive view helps me identify potential additional claims the client didn't mention, spot credibility issues that might affect case value, and determine whether the matter fits our practice focus and expertise areas.

Victory Conditions:
- Given attorney selects case for review When viewing details Then sees complete conversation transcript, client background information, preliminary legal analysis, and voice sentiment indicators
- Given case review in progress When updating status Then can mark as "Accept for Representation", "Consultation Needed", "Refer to Specialist", or "Decline - Not Our Practice Area"
- Given case status updated When making decisions Then can schedule client callbacks, generate retainer agreements, or create referral documentation

---

### Story 15: Real-time Legal Alert and Notification System [12 XP]
As a law firm partner  
I want to receive immediate alerts for high-priority legal matters  
So that emergency cases and high-value opportunities receive prompt attention

Description:
As managing partner of a growing law firm, I've learned that rapid response to emergency legal matters and high-value cases directly impacts both our reputation and revenue. The notification system must distinguish between different types of urgency: true legal emergencies requiring immediate action, high-value cases that merit partner attention, potential conflicts of interest requiring immediate review, and matters involving existing clients that need expedited handling. The system should provide enough detail to enable immediate decision-making about resource allocation and response priorities.

Victory Conditions:
- Given emergency legal matter identified When AI detects urgency indicators Then immediate alert sent to duty partner with case details and recommended immediate actions
- Given high-value case opportunity When significant case indicators present Then partner receives priority notification with preliminary case assessment and client background
- Given existing client calls with new matter When client relationship identified Then assigned attorney receives immediate notification with full client history and current matter details

### Story 16: Legal Practice Analytics and Compliance Reporting [16 XP]
As a firm administrator  
I want comprehensive analytics with legal compliance tracking  
So that I can optimize practice efficiency while meeting ethical and regulatory requirements

Description:
As a law firm administrator with responsibility for both operational efficiency and regulatory compliance, I need analytics that address the unique requirements of legal practice. Beyond standard business metrics, I must track attorney-client privilege protection, conflict check completion rates, statute of limitations deadline management, and client communication response times. The system must provide insights into case acceptance patterns, referral source effectiveness, and practice area profitability while maintaining detailed audit trails for malpractice insurance requirements and bar association compliance reviews.

Victory Conditions:
- Given client communications processed When monitoring compliance Then tracks confidentiality protection >99.9%, conflict check completion rates, and response time to emergency matters
- Given practice management metrics When viewing analytics Then shows case acceptance rates by practice area, average case values, client satisfaction indicators, and attorney workload distribution
- Given regulatory reporting requirements When generating compliance reports Then provides audit trails of client communications, conflict checking procedures, deadline management, and professional responsibility compliance with full documentation
