# Voice AI Kata: Financial Services Integration MVP

## System Overview
Voice-first AI system for **Financial Services** handling **Website / Database Integration** with **Offline Mode capability**. **Bank customers and loan applicants** call to **verify transactions, check balances, update account information, and submit loan pre-applications**. AI handles conversations during **peak call volumes and system maintenance** or when all customer service representatives are busy, captures **account verification, transaction disputes, and application data**, syncs with core banking systems, and creates prioritized cases for financial advisors to review.

**Core Problem:** Credit union receives 200+ customer service calls daily, with 30% being simple account inquiries that tie up representatives. During system maintenance windows, customers can't access online banking. Voice AI provides always-available service with real-time database integration and offline capability during outages.
